# Some little detail

Like in video games, there are hidden levels that might be left unkown, but once discovered, they can be a lot of fun.

## The color of the text in voice input

We use OA's native API to do voice input, before we gain access to these APIs, we have to request API permission which might take some time. But we don't want to add yet another loading animation, instead we first set the color of the text in the voice input to gray, and then change it to black once we have access to the APIs.

## Double click on question

Sometimes we want to ask the same question to test LLM performance, instead of manually copy and paste the question, we can double click on the question to copy it and paste it to the input box.

## Follow OA's settings whenever we can
